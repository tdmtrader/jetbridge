# CGX — Helm Chart Parity

## Frustrations

- [2026-02-10] Pre-commit hook auto-committed all dirty files (including unrelated unstaged changes from another track) with a different commit message. The chart changes ended up mixed with auditor/wrappa fixes in a single commit. Consider staging explicitly and verifying staged-only before commit.
