# CGX: Codebase Hardening

> Conductor Growth Experience — capture friction, patterns, and improvement candidates during implementation.

## Frustrations / Friction

<!-- Record friction points encountered during implementation -->

## Good Patterns to Encode

<!-- Patterns that worked well and should be reused -->

## Anti-Patterns to Prevent

<!-- Things that went wrong and should be avoided -->

## Missing Capabilities

<!-- Tools, skills, or automation that would have helped -->

## Improvement Candidates

<!-- Specific ideas for new skills, commands, or agents -->
